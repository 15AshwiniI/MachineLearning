I used this Reinforcement Learning Library: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/

Its zip file contains information about how to run it, but you basically navigate to that directory and type in java -jar rl_sim.jar.

I used the 4_multipleGoals2.maze and the 8_big.maze for this project. They are both mentioned in the analysis.
